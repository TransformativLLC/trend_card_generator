      "- Analyze financial statements, contracts, and operational documents\n",
      "- Identify potential compliance risks\n",
      "- Detect anomalies or inconsistencies across merged entities\n",
      "- Generate comprehensive risk assessment reports within hours instead of weeks\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Workforce Integration and Talent Mapping\n",
      "AI-driven talent analytics provide nuanced insights into human capital during mergers:\n",
      "- Skill gap analysis across combined organizations\n",
      "- Predictive modeling of employee retention risks\n",
